## About

This repository contains the example for learning Docker from SOSCON PH 2025 from Mr. Joseph Baking (Senior Manager in Samsung R&D Institute Philippines).

### Reflection

I really enjoyed his workshop on Docker, from the introduc  tion up to the more advanced topics. I learned a lot, especially about navigating the CLI.

I was also amazed by how he set up a small server using his old mini PC, allowing us to access and use a bare Debian environment directly from the browser. It was fascinating to see his own terminal in real time as he explained each concept!
